# Google's PageRank: A toy example

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank web pages in their search engine results.

## Requirements

Write a software which implements and tests the PageRank algorithm on the toy example proposed in the "Presentation.pdf" file.

Since it is just a toy example, implement the SelectionSort and the InsertionSort to rank the web pages.
